# Go Fundamentals Lesson Series

Welcome to the Go Fundamentals Lesson Series! This series is designed to introduce you to the basics of programming in Go, covering everything from basic syntax to advanced features like concurrency. Whether you're new to programming or an experienced developer looking to get started with Go, these lessons will help you get up to speed.

## Getting Started

Before you begin, make sure you have Go installed on your system. You can download Go from [the official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/). Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

To verify that Go is installed correctly, open a terminal and run:

```bash
go version
```

You should see the installed version of Go displayed.

## Structure of the Lessons

The lessons are organized into a series of directories under the `lessons` folder, each corresponding to a specific topic:

- `lessons/l1`: Lesson 1 - Introduction to Go
- `lessons/l2`: Lesson 2 - Variables, Types, and Control Structures
- `lessons/l3`: Lesson 3 - Advanced Types
- `lessons/l4`: Lesson 4 - Concurrency
- `lessons/l5`: Lesson 5 - Working with Files and I/O

Each lesson directory contains a `README.md` with an overview and learning objectives for the lesson, along with a `.go` file with example code.

## Running the Code

To run the code examples included with each lesson, navigate to the lesson's directory in your terminal and run the Go file with the `go run` command. For example, to run the code for Lesson 1:

```bash
cd lessons/l1
go run lesson1.go
```

## Following Along

As you work through the lessons, I encourage you to modify the example code and experiment on your own. Go is a powerful language with a lot of features to explore, and playing with the code is one of the best ways to learn.

## Asking Questions

If you have any questions or run into issues, please don't hesitate to ask for help. You can raise an issue in this repository, and we'll do our best to assist you.

## Next Steps

After completing these lessons, you will have a solid foundation in Go programming. From here, you can dive deeper into specific areas of interest, such as web development with Go, building microservices, or exploring Go's powerful standard library.

Happy coding!
